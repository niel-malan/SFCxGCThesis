abstract = {This review surveys chromatographic technology that has been applied to the characterization of biodiesel and its blends. Typically, biodiesel consists of fatty acid methyl esters produced by transesterification of plant or animal derived triacylglycerols. Primary attention is given to the determination of trace impurities in biodiesel, such as methanol, glycerol, mono-, di-, and triacylglycerols, and sterol glucosides. The determination of the fatty acid methyl esters, trace impurities in biodiesel, and the determination of the biodiesel content of commercial blends of biodiesel in conventional diesel are also addressed.},

abstract = {Fatty acid methyl esters from various fats and oils were separated by comprehensive two-dimensional supercritical fluid chromatography with conventional packed columns and FID detection. The first dimension was a silica gel column and the second dimension was an ODS column. This combination was largely orthogonal for the separation of fatty acid methyl esters. The first dimension separations were primarily based on the number of double bonds while the second dimension separations were based on the chain length. The highly-ordered chromatograms and improved resolution allowed the easy detection and identification of minor components. Although the first dimension separations were performed under isobaric conditions where the peak width increased in proportion to the retention, the programming of the sampling duration allowed us to maintain the optimum re-injection frequency (3-4 times) per peak into the second dimension and so to minimize the total analysis time without deteriorating the resolution.},

abstract = {In the early days of supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), it was categorized as high-pressure or dense gas chromatography (HPGC or DGC) and low boiling point hydrocarbons were used as supercritical mobile phase. Various liquids and gases were examined, however, by the late 1970s, carbon dioxide (CO₂) became the most preferred fluid because it has low critical temperature (31.1°C) and relatively low critical pressure (7.38 MPa); in addition, it is non-toxic, non-flammable and inexpensive. A prototype of a modern packed-column SFC instrument appeared in the late 1970s. However, in the 1980s, as open tubular capillary columns appeared and there was keen competition with packed columns. And packed-column SFC at once became less popular, but it regained popularity in the early 1990s. The history of SFC was of "the rise and fall." Advances in chiral stationary phase took place in the early 1990s made packed-column SFC truly useful chiral separation method and SFC is now regarded as an inevitable separation tool both in analytical and preparative separation.},

@article{Venter2006,
abstract = {A porous layer open tubular (PLOT) silica gel column was used together with subcritical CO2 as the mobile phase to effect the group separation of polar oxygenated compounds. Aliphatic and aromatic compounds were shown to elute together. This group was followed by ethers and aldehydes, which were separated from compounds containing an alcohol functional group. Compounds with a carboxylic acid moiety could also be eluted from the silica gel. The group separation obtained when a silica gel PLOT column is used together with subcritical CO2 was also demonstrated to be valuable as the first dimension of a comprehensive two-dimensional SFCxGC analysis where the GC analysis in the second dimension is performed with a fast and independently heated temperature programmed gas chromatograph. With this combination of SFC and GC, many of the oxygenated compounds, routinely found in petroleum samples, could successfully be separated and identified.},

abstract = {With comprehensive two-dimensional supercritical fluid and fast, independent temperature-programmed gas chromatography (SFCxGC), a polar column was used in the first dimension to achieve group-type analysis. The eluent of this separation was repetitively sampled and transferred to a fast, resistively heated gas chromatograph to obtain the boiling point distribution over the entire polarity separation. The SFC was operated isothermally with stopped flow to provide a sufficient time span for the GC analysis. The GC analysis had a typical cycle time of 1 min for the system demonstrated here. During this time, the GC column was independently heated at a rate of 450 degrees C/min to 250 degrees C and actively cooled again to -50 degrees C before the next GC injection took place. The analysis of petrochemical samples is presented to illustrate the technique.},
