  volume = {79},

  abstract = {Most common analytical methods in FA chemistry can be categorized
	as yielding either structure or quality indices. Quality indices
	often describe components in fats and oils arising from processing,
	storage, and naturally occurring, nonfatty materials. Common structure
	indices are the iodine value (IV), the saponification value, and
	the hydroxyl value. Although modern analytical methods yield more
	detailed and reliable information, structure indices are still widely
	used. The IV, which indicates total unsaturation, has even been included
	in some standards for industrial products such as biodiesel. However,
	the IV index is too general to allow the correlation of physical
	and chemical properties with FA composition. The IV is treated in
	a theoretical fashion regarding biodiesel- and oxidative stability-related
	issues. That the concept of IV as a structure index is unsatisfactory
	is shown by the development of a quaternary composition diagram (QCD).
	The QCD demonstrates the derivation of a specific IV from varying
	FA compositions. Improved correlations are possible among the structure
	indices. Alternative indices for the IV are developed. Possible alternatives
	are the allylic position equivalent (APE) and the bis-allylic position
	equivalent (BAPE), which better relate structure and amount of common
	component FA in vegetable oils to observed properties. The APE and
	BAPE indices are based on the number of reactive positions in oxidation.},

	presents an alternative volumetric method, which does not need expensive

	that it also overcomes the shortcomings of the GC procedure, such
	as detection limits and type of raw material used to produce biodiesel.

  abstract = {Fatty acid methyl esters were separated by a packed capillary supercritical
	fluid chromatographic (SFC) column and detected by a UV detector
	at the wavelength of 206 nm. The temperature controlled restrictor
	was designed for UV detection. The temperature controlled restrictor
	is a 20 cm length of deactivated fused silica of 7 Î¼m i.d., which
	is held right after UV detector of the packed capillary SFC. The
	temperature of the restrictor will control the flow rate of the supercritical
	carbon dioxide mobile phase through the packed capillary column in
	SFC. Thus, as the pressure in the column is increased during a pressure
	program, the temperature of 7 Î¼m fused silica tube can be varied
	to maintain a constant flow rate. Copyright Â© Taylor & Francis Group,

  abstract = {In the early days of supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), it
	was categorized as high-pressure or dense gas chromatography (HPGC
	or DGC) and low boiling point hydrocarbons were used as supercritical
	mobile phase. Various liquids and gases were examined, however, by
	the late 1970s, carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) became the most preferred
	fluid because it has low critical temperature (31.1Â°C) and relatively
	low critical pressure (7.38 MPa); in addition, it is non-toxic, non-flammable
	and inexpensive. A prototype of a modern packed-column SFC instrument
	appeared in the late 1970s. However, in the 1980s, as open tubular
	capillary columns appeared and there was keen competition with packed
	columns. And packed-column SFC at once became less popular, but it
	regained popularity in the early 1990s. The history of SFC was of
	"the rise and fall." Advances in chiral stationary phase took place
	in the early 1990s made packed-column SFC truly useful chiral separation
	method and SFC is now regarded as an inevitable separation tool both
	in analytical and preparative separation.},
