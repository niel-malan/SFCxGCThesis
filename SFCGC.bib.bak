	The taxonomy categorizes reviews according to: (a) focus; (b) goal;
	(c) perspective; (d) coverage; (e) organization; and (f) audience.
	The seven winners of the American Educational Research Association's
	Research Review Award are used to illustrate the taxonomy's categories.
	Data on the reliability of taxonomy codings when applied by readers
	is presented. Results of a survey of review authors provides baseline
	data on how frequently different types of reviews appear in the education
	and psychology literature. How the taxonomy might help in judging
	the quality of literature reviews is discussed, along with more general
	standards for evaluating reviews. ¬© 1988 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Within the biodiesel production process, glycerol arises as a side

	amounts. Several methods are known to determine it. Some of them

	is introduced that is based on the extraction of free glycerol into
	water and its subsequent determination in water solution by high-performance
	liquid chromatography (HPLC) with refractometric detection. Comparison
	of the GC and HPLC methods showed that they led to the same results.
	The new method is reliable and comparatively fast for the determination
	of free glycerol in biodiesel.},

  volume = {79},

  abstract = {Most common analytical methods in FA chemistry can be categorized
	as yielding either structure or quality indices. Quality indices
	often describe components in fats and oils arising from processing,
	storage, and naturally occurring, nonfatty materials. Common structure
	indices are the iodine value (IV), the saponification value, and
	the hydroxyl value. Although modern analytical methods yield more
	detailed and reliable information, structure indices are still widely
	used. The IV, which indicates total unsaturation, has even been included
	in some standards for industrial products such as biodiesel. However,
	the IV index is too general to allow the correlation of physical
	and chemical properties with FA composition. The IV is treated in
	a theoretical fashion regarding biodiesel- and oxidative stability-related
	issues. That the concept of IV as a structure index is unsatisfactory
	is shown by the development of a quaternary composition diagram (QCD).
	The QCD demonstrates the derivation of a specific IV from varying
	FA compositions. Improved correlations are possible among the structure
	indices. Alternative indices for the IV are developed. Possible alternatives
	are the allylic position equivalent (APE) and the bis-allylic position
	equivalent (BAPE), which better relate structure and amount of common
	component FA in vegetable oils to observed properties. The APE and
	BAPE indices are based on the number of reactive positions in oxidation.},

  abstract = {In the past few years, biodiesel has gained considerable attention
	due to the increasing concern for the environmental problems associated
	with the use of fossil fuels. The quality control of this renewable
	fuel involves numerous analyses, several of them requiring the use
	of analytical instruments. According to ASTM and EN standards, the
	analyses of free and total glycerin which are of particular relevance
	to biodiesel quality must be carried out by GC analysis. This work
	presents an alternative volumetric method, which does not need expensive
	equipment, and is therefore particularly useful for quality control
	in small facilities. Another advantage of the proposed method is
	that it also overcomes the shortcomings of the GC procedure, such
	as detection limits and type of raw material used to produce biodiesel.
	While the GC analysis is restricted to biodiesel obtained from soybean,
	rapeseed or sunflower oil, the volumetric method has no limitations
	in this sense. ¬© 2010 American Chemical Society.},
