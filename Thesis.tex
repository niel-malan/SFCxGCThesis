I gratefully acknowledge my supervisor, Prof Egmont Rohwer, who had the faith in me to invite me to take on the project, and the patience to wait for me to respond and the patience to wait for me to finish. I am extremely grateful for the funding he supplied at the beginning of the project, when funding was a real problem. 

My thanks to David Masemula, who maintained the supply of gas cylinders.

Yvette Naudé has been a most kind and helpful lab manager.

Kobie Smit lent a kind ear to the laments, and helped me feel less alone.

Marc Bouwer, whose youthful energy proved to be highly contagious, spent hours in front of the whiteboard with me, helping to clarify thoughts and understanding basic science.

My father, Danie Malan, spent a lot of energy and time on being an instrument maker for me.

My mother, Retha Malan, made sure that feeding myself during this time was as simple as possbile.

For Sunil Patel, who, in true hacker spirit, made the \LaTeX template this document is based on freely available.

Sasol Fuel, who saw the need for expertise, and started acting as a major funding source. This freed up so many resources.

For Beyers at Chemetrix, who spent effort in keeping our outdated HP instrumentation running.

For Agilent, who supplied us with an excellent used intrument at a nominal cost.

For Barbara Lotze, for whose support I will be eternally grateful. 

Johan Erasmus, whose professional psychological help was crucial in getting me unstuck.

Dok Fanie (Dr SJ van der Walt) who was appointed as my co-supervisor, but was also my predecessor, was willing to lend an ear and encourage, supply new ideas.  "Works well when under constant supervision and cornered like a rat in a trap."

Antoinette ??insert surname of the Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis at the University of Pretoria provided invaluable aid in performing the SEM images.

The financial assistance of the South African National Energy Research Institute towards this research is hereby acknowledged. Opinions expressed and conclusions arrived at, are those of the author and are not necessarily to be attributed to SANERI.
